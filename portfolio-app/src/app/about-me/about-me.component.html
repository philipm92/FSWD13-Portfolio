            <p>
                I successfully graduated from <q>Fachschule f√ºr Informationstechnik</q> at the HTL Rennweg 1030 Vienna, as well as the <q>Berufsreifepr&uuml;fung</q> at VHS-Meidling in 1120 Vienna.
                <br /><br />
                Shortly after that I was self-employed for two years after losing over 50 kilos over a two year period with a very holistic and diet-free weight loss approach.
                <br /><br />
                In addition, I successfully completed the full stack web developer course at Code Factory Vienna in fall of 2021. There I was able to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
